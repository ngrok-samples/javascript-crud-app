# Build a CRUD Application with JavaScript
This project showcases how to build a CRUD application using JavaScript. The application contains a REST API built in [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) and utilizing [Express](https://expressjs.com/). Data will be saved and retrieved from a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) database. The frontend is a [React](https://react.dev) application that uses [React Routes](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for navigation.

This sample is referenced, and more clearly explained, is post forr the [ngrok blog](https://ngrok.com/blog) called [Build a CRUD app with Node.js](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/nodejs-crud-app-tutorial)
